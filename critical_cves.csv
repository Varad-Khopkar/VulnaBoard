The eeprom->v{1,2}.len is set by the driver in p54_download_eeprom().
The device is supposed to provide the same length back to the driver.
But yes, it's possible (like shown in the report) to alter the value
to something that causes a crash/panic due to overrun.

This patch addresses the issue by adding the size to the common device
context, so p54_rx_eeprom_readback no longer relies on possibly tampered
values... That said, it also checks if the ""firmware"" altered the value
and no longer copies them.

The one, small saving grace is: Before the driver tries to read the eeprom,
it needs to upload >a< firmware. the vendor firmware has a proprietary
license and as a reason, it is not present on most distributions by
default.",2025-07-10T09:15Z,N/A

The problem is when a module triggers an issue with ftrace and
sets ftrace_disable. The ftrace_disable is set when an anomaly is
discovered and to prevent any more damage, ftrace stops all text
modification. The issue that happened was that the ftrace_disable stops
more than just the text modification.

When a module is loaded, its init functions can also be traced. Because
kallsyms deletes the init functions after a module has loaded, ftrace
saves them when the module is loaded and function tracing is enabled. This
allows the output of the function trace to show the init function names
instead of just their raw memory addresses.

When a module is removed, ftrace_release_mod() is called, and if
ftrace_disable is set, it just returns without doing anything more. The
problem here is that it leaves the mod_list still around and if kallsyms
is called, it will call into this code and access the module memory that
has already been freed as it will return:

ACPICA: fix acpi operand cache leak in dswstate.c

terminates ACPI function and continues to boot process. While kernel terminates
ACPI function, kmem_cache_destroy() reports Acpi-Operand cache leak.

I analyzed this memory leak in detail and found acpi_ds_obj_stack_pop_and_
delete() function miscalculated the top of the stack. acpi_ds_obj_stack_push()
function uses walk_state->operand_index for start position of the top, but
acpi_ds_obj_stack_pop_and_delete() function considers index 0 for it.
Therefore, this causes acpi operand memory leak.

This cache leak causes a security threat because an old kernel (<= 4.9) shows
memory locations of kernel functions in stack dump. Some malicious users
could use this information to neutralize kernel ASLR.

I made a patch to fix ACPI operand cache leak.",2025-07-10T09:15Z,N/A

“Acpi-Parse” cache were merged because the size of cache objects was same
slab cache size.

I finally found “Acpi-Parse” cache and “Acpi-parse_ext” cache were leaked

arch_bpf_trampoline_size() provides JIT size of the BPF trampoline

instructions emitted for BPF trampoline JIT code depends on where
the final image is located. So, the size arrived at with the dummy

needed in  arch_prepare_bpf_trampoline().  When the instructions
accounted in  arch_bpf_trampoline_size() is less than the number of

CVE-2025-38338,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

fs/nfs/read: fix double-unlock bug in nfs_return_empty_folio()

Sometimes, when a file was read while it was being truncated by
another NFS client, the kernel could deadlock because folio_unlock()
was called twice, and the second call would XOR back the `PG_locked`
flag.

Most of the time (depending on the timing of the truncation), nobody
notices the problem because folio_unlock() gets called three times,
which flips `PG_locked` back off:

 1. vfs_read, nfs_read_folio, ... nfs_read_add_folio,
    nfs_return_empty_folio
 2. vfs_read, nfs_read_folio, ... netfs_read_collection,
    netfs_unlock_abandoned_read_pages
 3. vfs_read, ... nfs_do_read_folio, nfs_read_add_folio,
    nfs_return_empty_folio

The problem is that nfs_read_add_folio() is not supposed to unlock the
folio if fscache is enabled, and a nfs_netfs_folio_unlock() check is
missing in nfs_return_empty_folio().

Rarely this leads to a warning in netfs_read_collection():

CVE-2025-38334,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

x86/sgx: Prevent attempts to reclaim poisoned pages

TL;DR: SGX page reclaim touches the page to copy its contents to
secondary storage. SGX instructions do not gracefully handle machine
checks. Despite this, the existing SGX code will try to reclaim pages
that it _knows_ are poisoned. Avoid even trying to reclaim poisoned pages.

The longer story:

Pages used by an enclave only get epc_page->poison set in
arch_memory_failure() but they currently stay on sgx_active_page_list until
sgx_encl_release(), with the SGX_EPC_PAGE_RECLAIMER_TRACKED flag untouched.

epc_page->poison is not checked in the reclaimer logic meaning that, if other
conditions are met, an attempt will be made to reclaim an EPC page that was
poisoned.  This is bad because 1. we don't want that page to end up added
to another enclave and 2. it is likely to cause one core to shut down
and the kernel to panic.

Specifically, reclaiming uses microcode operations including ""EWB"" which
accesses the EPC page contents to encrypt and write them out to non-SGX
memory.  Those operations cannot handle MCEs in their accesses other than
by putting the executing core into a special shutdown state (affecting
both threads with HT.)  The kernel will subsequently panic on the
remaining cores seeing the core didn't enter MCE handler(s) in time.

Call sgx_unmark_page_reclaimable() to remove the affected EPC page from
sgx_active_page_list on memory error to stop it being considered for
reclaiming.

Testing epc_page->poison in sgx_reclaim_pages() would also work but I assume
it's better to add code in the less likely paths.

The affected EPC page is not added to &node->sgx_poison_page_list until
later in sgx_encl_release()->sgx_free_epc_page() when it is EREMOVEd.
Membership on other lists doesn't change to avoid changing any of the
lists' semantics except for sgx_active_page_list.  There's a ""TBD"" comment
in arch_memory_failure() about pre-emptive actions, the goal here is not
to address everything that it may imply.

This also doesn't completely close the time window when a memory error
notification will be fatal (for a not previously poisoned EPC page) --
the MCE can happen after sgx_reclaim_pages() has selected its candidates
or even *inside* a microcode operation (actually easy to trigger due to
the amount of time spent in them.)

The spinlock in sgx_unmark_page_reclaimable() is safe because
memory_failure() runs in process context and no spinlocks are held,
explicitly noted in a mm/memory-failure.c comment.",2025-07-10T09:15Z,N/A

net: ethernet: cortina: Use TOE/TSO on all TCP

It is desireable to push the hardware accelerator to also
process non-segmented TCP frames: we pass the skb->len
to the ""TOE/TSO"" offloader and it will handle them.

Without this quirk the driver becomes unstable and lock
up and and crash.

I do not know exactly why, but it is probably due to the
TOE (TCP offload engine) feature that is coupled with the
segmentation feature - it is not possible to turn one
part off and not the other, either both TOE and TSO are
active, or neither of them.

Not having the TOE part active seems detrimental, as if
that hardware feature is not really supposed to be turned
off.

The datasheet says:

  ""Based on packet parsing and TCP connection/NAT table
   lookup results, the NetEngine puts the packets
   belonging to the same TCP connection to the same queue
   for the software to process. The NetEngine puts
   incoming packets to the buffer or series of buffers

   IP/TCP header parsing, checksum validation and

result_sg_size field of the command is filled with the result length

This oversized result size causes two issues:
1. The state transferred to the destination includes 8 bytes of extra

2. The allocated buffer in the kernel may be smaller than the returned

Lockdep reports that we should cancel the work under crit_lock [splat1],
and that was the scheme we have mostly followed since [1] by Slawomir.
But when that is done we still got into deadlocks [splat2]. So instead
we should look at the bigger problem, namely ""weird locking/scheduling""
of the iavf. The first step to fix that is to remove the crit lock.
I will followup with a -next series that simplifies scheduling/tasks.

Cancel the work without netdev lock (weird unlock+lock scheme),
to fix the [splat2] (which would be totally ugly if we would kept
the crit lock).

Extend protected part of iavf_watchdog_task() to include scheduling
more work.

Note that the removed comment in iavf_reset_task() was misplaced,
it belonged to inside of the removed if condition, so it's gone now.

============================================

The best way to solve this is to remove the logic that checks
ptp->n_vclocks in ptp_vclock_in_use().

The reason why this is appropriate is that any path that uses
ptp->n_vclocks must unconditionally check if ptp->n_vclocks is greater
than 0 before unregistering vclocks, and all functions are already
written this way. And in the function that uses ptp->n_vclocks, we
already get ptp->n_vclocks_mux before unregistering vclocks.

Therefore, we need to remove the redundant check for ptp->n_vclocks in
ptp_vclock_in_use() to prevent recursive locking.",2025-07-10T08:15Z,N/A

EDAC/skx_common: Fix general protection fault

After loading i10nm_edac (which automatically loads skx_edac_common), if

a general protection fault may occur:

The issue arose was because the variable 'adxl_component_count' (inside
skx_edac_common), which counts the ADXL components, was not reset. During
the reloading of i10nm_edac, the count was incremented by the actual number
of ADXL components again, resulting in a count that was double the real
number of ADXL components. This led to an out-of-bounds reference to the
ADXL component array, causing the general protection fault above.

wifi: ath12k: fix NULL access in assign channel context handler

Currently, when ath12k_mac_assign_vif_to_vdev() fails, the radio handle
(ar) gets accessed from the link VIF handle (arvif) for debug logging, This
is incorrect. In the fail scenario, radio handle is NULL. Fix the NULL

wifi: ath11k: fix node corruption in ar->arvifs list

In current WLAN recovery code flow, ath11k_core_halt() only
reinitializes the ""arvifs"" list head. This will cause the
list node immediately following the list head to become an
invalid list node. Because the prev of that node still points

wifi: ath12k: Prevent sending WMI commands to firmware during firmware crash

Currently, we encounter the following kernel call trace when a firmware
crash occurs. This happens because the host sends WMI commands to the
firmware while it is in recovery, causing the commands to fail and
resulting in the kernel call trace.

Set the ATH12K_FLAG_CRASH_FLUSH and ATH12K_FLAG_RECOVERY flags when the
host driver receives the firmware crash notification from MHI. This
prevents sending WMI commands to the firmware during recovery.

CVE-2025-38282,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

kernfs: Relax constraint in draining guard

The active reference lifecycle provides the break/unbreak mechanism but
the active reference is not truly active after unbreak -- callers don't
use it afterwards but it's important for proper pairing of kn->active
counting. Assuming this mechanism is in place, the WARN check in
kernfs_should_drain_open_files() is too sensitive -- it may transiently
catch those (rightful) callers between
kernfs_unbreak_active_protection() and kernfs_put_active() as found out by Chen
Ridong:

	kernfs_remove_by_name_ns	kernfs_get_active // active=1
	__kernfs_remove					  // active=0x80000002
	kernfs_drain			...
	wait_event
	//waiting (active == 0x80000001)
					kernfs_break_active_protection
					// active = 0x80000001

					kernfs_unbreak_active_protection
					// active = 0x80000002
	...
	kernfs_should_drain_open_files
	// warning occurs
					kernfs_put_active

To avoid the false positives (mind panic_on_warn) remove the check altogether.

CVE-2025-38276,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

fs/dax: Fix ""don't skip locked entries when scanning entries""

Commit 6be3e21d25ca (""fs/dax: don't skip locked entries when scanning
entries"") introduced a new function, wait_entry_unlocked_exclusive(),
which waits for the current entry to become unlocked without advancing
the XArray iterator state.

Waiting for the entry to become unlocked requires dropping the XArray
lock. This requires calling xas_pause() prior to dropping the lock
which leaves the xas in a suitable state for the next iteration. However
this has the side-effect of advancing the xas state to the next index.
Normally this isn't an issue because xas_for_each() contains code to
detect this state and thus avoid advancing the index a second time on
the next loop iteration.

However both callers of and wait_entry_unlocked_exclusive() itself
subsequently use the xas state to reload the entry. As xas_pause()
updated the state to the next index this will cause the current entry
which is being waited on to be skipped. This caused the following
warning to fire intermittently when running xftest generic/068 on an XFS
filesystem with FS DAX enabled:

syzbot reported a refcount warning [1] caused by calling get_net() on

when a TIPC discovery timer fires during network namespace cleanup.

The recently added get_net() call in commit e279024617134 (""net/tipc:

hold a reference to the network namespace. However, if the namespace
is already being destroyed, its refcount might be zero, leading to the
use-after-free warning.

Replace get_net() with maybe_get_net(), which safely checks if the
refcount is non-zero before incrementing it. If the namespace is being
destroyed, return -ENODEV early, after releasing the bearer reference.

CVE-2025-38268,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

usb: typec: tcpm: move tcpm_queue_vdm_unlocked to asynchronous work

A state check was previously added to tcpm_queue_vdm_unlocked to
prevent a deadlock where the DisplayPort Alt Mode driver would be
executing work and attempting to grab the tcpm_lock while the TCPM
was holding the lock and attempting to unregister the altmode, blocking
on the altmode driver's cancel_work_sync call.

Because the state check isn't protected, there is a small window
where the Alt Mode driver could determine that the TCPM is
in a ready state and attempt to grab the lock while the
TCPM grabs the lock and changes the TCPM state to one that
causes the deadlock. The callstack is provided below:

CVE-2025-38267,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ring-buffer: Do not trigger WARN_ON() due to a commit_overrun

When reading a memory mapped buffer the reader page is just swapped out
with the last page written in the write buffer. If the reader page is the
same as the commit buffer (the buffer that is currently being written to)
it was assumed that it should never have missed events. If it does, it
triggers a WARN_ON_ONCE().

But there just happens to be one scenario where this can legitimately
happen. That is on a commit_overrun. A commit overrun is when an interrupt
preempts an event being written to the buffer and then the interrupt adds
so many new events that it fills and wraps the buffer back to the commit.
Any new events would then be dropped and be reported as ""missed_events"".

In this case, the next page to read is the commit buffer and after the
swap of the reader page, the reader page will be the commit buffer, but
this time there will be missed events and this triggers the following
warning:

CVE-2025-38266,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

pinctrl: mediatek: eint: Fix invalid pointer dereference for v1 platforms

Commit 3ef9f710efcb (""pinctrl: mediatek: Add EINT support for multiple
addresses"") introduced an access to the 'soc' field of struct
mtk_pinctrl in mtk_eint_do_init() and for that an include of
pinctrl-mtk-common-v2.h.

However, pinctrl drivers relying on the v1 common driver include
pinctrl-mtk-common.h instead, which provides another definition of
struct mtk_pinctrl that does not contain an 'soc' field.

Since mtk_eint_do_init() can be called both by v1 and v2 drivers, it
will now try to dereference an invalid pointer when called on v1
platforms. This has been observed on Genio 350 EVK (MT8365), which
crashes very early in boot (the kernel trace can only be seen with
earlycon).

In order to fix this, since 'struct mtk_pinctrl' was only needed to get
a 'struct mtk_eint_pin', make 'struct mtk_eint_pin' a parameter
of mtk_eint_do_init() so that callers need to supply it, removing
mtk_eint_do_init()'s dependency on any particular 'struct mtk_pinctrl'.",2025-07-10T08:15Z,N/A

tty: serial: uartlite: register uart driver in init

When two instances of uart devices are probing, a concurrency race can
occur. If one thread calls uart_register_driver function, which first
allocates and assigns memory to 'uart_state' member of uart_driver
structure, the other instance can bypass uart driver registration and
call ulite_assign. This calls uart_add_one_port, which expects the uart
driver to be fully initialized. This leads to a kernel panic due to a
null pointer dereference:

The issue comes from the put_user() in schedule_tail
(kernel/sched/core.c) doing the following:

asmlinkage __visible void schedule_tail(struct task_struct *prev)
{
...
        if (current->set_child_tid)
                put_user(task_pid_vnr(current), current->set_child_tid);
...
}

the put_user() macro causes the code sequence to come out as follows:

1:	__enable_user_access()
2:	reg = task_pid_vnr(current);
3:	*current->set_child_tid = reg;
4:	__disable_user_access()

The problem is that we may have a sleeping function as argument which
could clear SR_SUM causing the panic above. This was fixed by
evaluating the argument of the put_user() macro outside the user-enabled
section in commit 285a76bb2cf5 (""riscv: evaluate put_user() arg before
enabling user access"")""

In order for riscv to take advantage of unsafe_get/put_XXX() macros and
to avoid the same issue we had with put_user() and sleeping functions we
must ensure code flow can go through switch_to() from within a region of
code with SR_SUM enabled and come back with SR_SUM still enabled. This
patch addresses the problem allowing future work to enable full use of
unsafe_get/put_XXX() macros without needing to take a CSR bit flip cost
on every access. Make switch_to() save and restore SR_SUM.",2025-07-09T11:15Z,N/A

[CAUSE]
Firstly the fs has a corrupted csum tree root, thus to mount the fs we
have to go ""ro,rescue=ibadroots"" mount option.

Normally with that mount option, a bad csum tree root should set
BTRFS_FS_STATE_NO_DATA_CSUMS flag, so that any future data read will
ignore csum search.

But in this particular case, we have the following call trace that
caused NULL csum root, but not setting BTRFS_FS_STATE_NO_DATA_CSUMS:

load_global_roots_objectid():

		ret = btrfs_search_slot();
		/* Succeeded */
		btrfs_item_key_to_cpu()
		found = true;
		/* We found the root item for csum tree. */
		root = read_tree_root_path();
		if (IS_ERR(root)) {
			if (!btrfs_test_opt(fs_info, IGNOREBADROOTS))
			/*
			 * Since we have rescue=ibadroots mount option,
			 * @ret is still 0.
			 */
			break;
	if (!found || ret) {
		/* @found is true, @ret is 0, error handling for csum
		 * tree is skipped.
		 */
	}

This means we completely skipped to set BTRFS_FS_STATE_NO_DATA_CSUMS if
the csum tree is corrupted, which results unexpected later csum lookup.

[FIX]
If read_tree_root_path() failed, always populate @ret to the error
number.

As at the end of the function, we need @ret to determine if we need to
do the extra error handling for csum tree.",2025-07-09T11:15Z,N/A

Bluetooth: hci_core: Fix use-after-free in vhci_flush()

syzbot reported use-after-free in vhci_flush() without repro. [0]

From the splat, a thread close()d a vhci file descriptor while
its device was being used by iotcl() on another thread.

Once the last fd refcnt is released, vhci_release() calls
hci_unregister_dev(), hci_free_dev(), and kfree() for struct
vhci_data, which is set to hci_dev->dev->driver_data.

The problem is that there is no synchronisation after unlinking
hdev from hci_dev_list in hci_unregister_dev().  There might be
another thread still accessing the hdev which was fetched before
the unlink operation.

We can use SRCU for such synchronisation.

Let's run hci_dev_reset() under SRCU and wait for its completion
in hci_unregister_dev().

Another option would be to restore hci_dev->destruct(), which was
removed in commit 587ae086f6e4 (""Bluetooth: Remove unused
hci-destruct cb"").  However, this would not be a good solution, as
we should not run hci_unregister_dev() while there are in-flight
ioctl() requests, which could lead to another data-race KCSAN splat.

Note that other drivers seem to have the same problem, for exmaple,
virtbt_remove().

and its fields are accessed without verifying that the buffer
is large enough. If the device returns a smaller than expected
length, this leads to an out-of-bounds read.

Add a length check to ensure the buffer is large enough for
uac3_cluster_header_descriptor.",2025-07-09T11:15Z,N/A
CVE-2025-38248,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

bridge: mcast: Fix use-after-free during router port configuration

The bridge maintains a global list of ports behind which a multicast
router resides. The list is consulted during forwarding to ensure
multicast packets are forwarded to these ports even if the ports are not
member in the matching MDB entry.

When per-VLAN multicast snooping is enabled, the per-port multicast
context is disabled on each port and the port is removed from the global
router port list:

 # ip link add name br1 up type bridge vlan_filtering 1 mcast_snooping 1
 # ip link add name dummy1 up master br1 type dummy
 # ip link set dev dummy1 type bridge_slave mcast_router 2
 $ bridge -d mdb show | grep router
 router ports on br1: dummy1
 # ip link set dev br1 type bridge mcast_vlan_snooping 1
 $ bridge -d mdb show | grep router

However, the port can be re-added to the global list even when per-VLAN
multicast snooping is enabled:

 # ip link set dev dummy1 type bridge_slave mcast_router 0
 # ip link set dev dummy1 type bridge_slave mcast_router 2
 $ bridge -d mdb show | grep router
 router ports on br1: dummy1

Since commit 4b30ae9adb04 (""net: bridge: mcast: re-implement
br_multicast_{enable, disable}_port functions""), when per-VLAN multicast
snooping is enabled, multicast disablement on a port will disable the
per-{port, VLAN} multicast contexts and not the per-port one. As a
result, a port will remain in the global router port list even after it
is deleted. This will lead to a use-after-free [1] when the list is
traversed (when adding a new port to the list, for example):

 # ip link del dev dummy1
 # ip link add name dummy2 up master br1 type dummy
 # ip link set dev dummy2 type bridge_slave mcast_router 2

Similarly, stale entries can also be found in the per-VLAN router port
list. When per-VLAN multicast snooping is disabled, the per-{port, VLAN}
contexts are disabled on each port and the port is removed from the
per-VLAN router port list:

 # ip link add name br1 up type bridge vlan_filtering 1 mcast_snooping 1 mcast_vlan_snooping 1
 # ip link add name dummy1 up master br1 type dummy
 # bridge vlan add vid 2 dev dummy1
 # bridge vlan global set vid 2 dev br1 mcast_snooping 1
 # bridge vlan set vid 2 dev dummy1 mcast_router 2
 $ bridge vlan global show dev br1 vid 2 | grep router
       router ports: dummy1
 # ip link set dev br1 type bridge mcast_vlan_snooping 0
 $ bridge vlan global show dev br1 vid 2 | grep router

However, the port can be re-added to the per-VLAN list even when
per-VLAN multicast snooping is disabled:

 # bridge vlan set vid 2 dev dummy1 mcast_router 0
 # bridge vlan set vid 2 dev dummy1 mcast_router 2
 $ bridge vlan global show dev br1 vid 2 | grep router
       router ports: dummy1

When the VLAN is deleted from the port, the per-{port, VLAN} multicast
context will not be disabled since multicast snooping is not enabled
on the VLAN. As a result, the port will remain in the per-VLAN router
port list even after it is no longer member in the VLAN. This will lead
to a use-after-free [2] when the list is traversed (when adding a new
port to the list, for example):

 # ip link add name dummy2 up master br1 type dummy
 # bridge vlan add vid 2 dev dummy2
 # bridge vlan del vid 2 dev dummy1
 # bridge vlan set vid 2 dev dummy2 mcast_router 2

Fix these issues by removing the port from the relevant (global or
per-VLAN) router port list in br_multicast_port_ctx_deinit(). The
function is invoked during port deletion with the per-port multicast
context and during VLAN deletion with the per-{port, VLAN} multicast
context.

Note that deleting the multicast router timer is not enough as it only
takes care of the temporary multicast router states (1 or 3) and not the
permanent one (2).

CVE-2025-38245,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

atm: Release atm_dev_mutex after removing procfs in atm_dev_deregister().

syzbot reported a warning below during atm_dev_register(). [0]

Before creating a new device and procfs/sysfs for it, atm_dev_register()
looks up a duplicated device by __atm_dev_lookup().  These operations are
done under atm_dev_mutex.

However, when removing a device in atm_dev_deregister(), it releases the
mutex just after removing the device from the list that __atm_dev_lookup()
iterates over.

So, there will be a small race window where the device does not exist on
the device list but procfs/sysfs are still not removed, triggering the
splat.

Let's hold the mutex until procfs/sysfs are removed in
atm_dev_deregister().

btrfs: fix invalid inode pointer dereferences during log replay

CVE-2025-38242,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

mm: userfaultfd: fix race of userfaultfd_move and swap cache

This commit fixes two kinds of races, they may have different results:

Barry reported a BUG_ON in commit c50f8e6053b0, we may see the same
BUG_ON if the filemap lookup returned NULL and folio is added to swap
cache after that.

If another kind of race is triggered (folio changed after lookup) we
may see RSS counter is corrupted:

[  406.893936] BUG: Bad rss-counter state mm:ffff0000c5a9ddc0
type:MM_ANONPAGES val:-1
[  406.894071] BUG: Bad rss-counter state mm:ffff0000c5a9ddc0
type:MM_SHMEMPAGES val:1

Because the folio is being accounted to the wrong VMA.

I'm not sure if there will be any data corruption though, seems no. 
The issues above are critical already.


On seeing a swap entry PTE, userfaultfd_move does a lockless swap cache
lookup, and tries to move the found folio to the faulting vma.  Currently,
it relies on checking the PTE value to ensure that the moved folio still
belongs to the src swap entry and that no new folio has been added to the
swap cache, which turns out to be unreliable.

While working and reviewing the swap table series with Barry, following
existing races are observed and reproduced [1]:

In the example below, move_pages_pte is moving src_pte to dst_pte, where
src_pte is a swap entry PTE holding swap entry S1, and S1 is not in the
swap cache:

CPU1                               CPU2
userfaultfd_move
  move_pages_pte()
    entry = pte_to_swp_entry(orig_src_pte);
    // Here it got entry = S1
    ... < interrupted> ...
                                   <swapin src_pte, alloc and use folio A>
                                   // folio A is a new allocated folio
                                   // and get installed into src_pte
                                   <frees swap entry S1>
                                   // src_pte now points to folio A, S1
                                   // has swap count == 0, it can be freed
                                   // by folio_swap_swap or swap
                                   // allocator's reclaim.
                                   <try to swap out another folio B>
                                   // folio B is a folio in another VMA.
                                   <put folio B to swap cache using S1 >
                                   // S1 is freed, folio B can use it
                                   // for swap out with no problem.
                                   ...
    folio = filemap_get_folio(S1)
    // Got folio B here !!!
    ... < interrupted again> ...
                                   <swapin folio B and free S1>
                                   // Now S1 is free to be used again.
                                   <swapout src_pte & folio A using S1>
                                   // Now src_pte is a swap entry PTE
                                   // holding S1 again.
    folio_trylock(folio)
    move_swap_pte
      double_pt_lock
      is_pte_pages_stable
      // Check passed because src_pte == S1
      folio_move_anon_rmap(...)
      // Moved invalid folio B here !!!

The race window is very short and requires multiple collisions of multiple
rare events, so it's very unlikely to happen, but with a deliberately
constructed reproducer and increased time window, it can be reproduced
easily.

This can be fixed by checking if the folio returned by filemap is the
valid swap cache folio after acquiring the folio lock.

Another similar race is possible: filemap_get_folio may return NULL, but
folio (A) could be swapped in and then swapped out again using the same
swap entry after the lookup.  In such a case, folio (A) may remain in the
swap cache, so it must be moved too:

CPU1                               CPU2
userfaultfd_move
  move_pages_pte()
    entry = pte_to_swp_entry(orig_src_pte);
    // Here it got entry = S1, and S1 is not in swap cache
    folio = filemap_get

The reason is simple, readahead brought some order 0 folio in swap cache,
and the swapin mTHP folio being allocated is in conflict with it, so
swapcache_prepare fails and causes shmem_swap_alloc_folio to return
-EEXIST, and shmem simply retries again and again causing this loop.

Fix it by applying a similar fix for anon mTHP swapin.

The performance change is very slight, time of swapin 10g zero folios
with shmem (test for 12 times):
Before:  2.47s
After:   2.48s

CVE-2025-48386,"Git is a fast, scalable, distributed revision control system with an unusually rich command set that provides both high-level operations and full access to internals. The wincred credential helper uses a static buffer (target) as a unique key for storing and comparing against internal storage. This credential helper does not properly bounds check the available space remaining in the buffer before appending to it with wcsncat(), leading to potential buffer overflows. This vulnerability is fixed in v2.43.7, v2.44.4, v2.45.4, v2.46.4, v2.47.3, v2.48.2, v2.49.1, and v2.50.1.",2025-07-08T19:15Z,N/A
CVE-2025-48385,"Git is a fast, scalable, distributed revision control system with an unusually rich command set that provides both high-level operations and full access to internals. When cloning a repository Git knows to optionally fetch a bundle advertised by the remote server, which allows the server-side to offload parts of the clone to a CDN. The Git client does not perform sufficient validation of the advertised bundles, which allows the remote side to perform protocol injection. This protocol injection can cause the client to write the fetched bundle to a location controlled by the adversary. The fetched content is fully controlled by the server, which can in the worst case lead to arbitrary code execution. The use of bundle URIs is not enabled by default and can be controlled by the bundle.heuristic config option. Some cases of the vulnerability require that the adversary is in control of where a repository will be cloned to. This either requires social engineering or a recursive clone with submodules. These cases can thus be avoided by disabling recursive clones. This vulnerability is fixed in v2.43.7, v2.44.4, v2.45.4, v2.46.4, v2.47.3, v2.48.2, v2.49.1, and v2.50.1.",2025-07-08T19:15Z,N/A
CVE-2025-48384,"Git is a fast, scalable, distributed revision control system with an unusually rich command set that provides both high-level operations and full access to internals. When reading a config value, Git strips any trailing carriage return and line feed (CRLF). When writing a config entry, values with a trailing CR are not quoted, causing the CR to be lost when the config is later read. When initializing a submodule, if the submodule path contains a trailing CR, the altered path is read resulting in the submodule being checked out to an incorrect location. If a symlink exists that points the altered path to the submodule hooks directory, and the submodule contains an executable post-checkout hook, the script may be unintentionally executed after checkout.

CVE-2025-38236,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

af_unix: Don't leave consecutive consumed OOB skbs.

Jann Horn reported a use-after-free in unix_stream_read_generic().

The following sequences reproduce the issue:

  $ python3
  from socket import *
  s1, s2 = socketpair(AF_UNIX, SOCK_STREAM)
  s1.send(b'x', MSG_OOB)
  s2.recv(1, MSG_OOB)     # leave a consumed OOB skb
  s1.send(b'y', MSG_OOB)
  s2.recv(1, MSG_OOB)     # leave a consumed OOB skb
  s1.send(b'z', MSG_OOB)
  s2.recv(1)              # recv 'z' illegally
  s2.recv(1, MSG_OOB)     # access 'z' skb (use-after-free)

Even though a user reads OOB data, the skb holding the data stays on
the recv queue to mark the OOB boundary and break the next recv().

After the last send() in the scenario above, the sk2's recv queue has
2 leading consumed OOB skbs and 1 real OOB skb.

Then, the following happens during the next recv() without MSG_OOB

  1. unix_stream_read_generic() peeks the first consumed OOB skb
  2. manage_oob() returns the next consumed OOB skb
  3. unix_stream_read_generic() fetches the next not-yet-consumed OOB skb
  4. unix_stream_read_generic() reads and frees the OOB skb

, and the last recv(MSG_OOB) triggers KASAN splat.

The 3. above occurs because of the SO_PEEK_OFF code, which does not
expect unix_skb_len(skb) to be 0, but this is true for such consumed
OOB skbs.

  while (skip >= unix_skb_len(skb)) {
    skip -= unix_skb_len(skb);
    skb = skb_peek_next(skb, &sk->sk_receive_queue);
    ...
  }

In addition to this use-after-free, there is another issue that
ioctl(SIOCATMARK) does not function properly with consecutive consumed
OOB skbs.

So, nothing good comes out of such a situation.

Instead of complicating manage_oob(), ioctl() handling, and the next
ECONNRESET fix by introducing a loop for consecutive consumed OOB skbs,
let's not leave such consecutive OOB unnecessarily.

Now, while receiving an OOB skb in unix_stream_recv_urg(), if its
previous skb is a consumed OOB skb, it is freed.

CVE-2025-48952,"NetAlertX is a network, presence scanner, and alert framework. Prior to version 25.6.7, a vulnerability in the authentication logic allows users to bypass password verification using SHA-256 magic hashes, due to loose comparison in PHP. In vulnerable versions of the application, a password comparison is performed using the `==` operator at line 40 in front/index.php. This introduces a security issue where specially crafted ""magic hash"" values that evaluate to true in a loose comparison can bypass authentication. Because of the use of `==` instead of the strict `===`, different strings that begin with 0e and are followed by only digits can be interpreted as scientific notation (i.e., zero) and treated as equal. This issue falls under the Login Bypass vulnerability class. Users with certain ""weird"" passwords that produce magic hashes are particularly affected. Services relying on this logic are at risk of unauthorized access. Version 25.6.7 fixes the vulnerability.",2025-07-04T23:15Z,N/A

CVE-2025-46733,"OP-TEE is a Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) designed as companion to a non-secure Linux kernel running on Arm; Cortex-A cores using the TrustZone technology. In version 4.5.0, using a specially crafted tee-supplicant binary running in REE userspace, an attacker can trigger a panic in a TA that uses the libutee Secure Storage API. Many functions in libutee, specifically those which make up the Secure Storage API, will panic if a system call returns an unexpected return code. This behavior is mandated by the TEE Internal Core API specification. However, in OP-TEE’s implementation, return codes of secure storage operations are passed through unsanitized from the REE tee-supplicant, through the Linux kernel tee-driver, through the OP-TEE kernel, back to libutee. Thus, an attacker with access to REE userspace, and the ability to stop tee-supplicant and replace it with their own process (generally trivial for a root user, and depending on the way permissions are set up, potentially available even to less privileged users) can run a malicious tee-supplicant process that responds to storage requests with unexpected response codes, triggering a panic in the requesting TA. This is particularly dangerous for TAs built with `TA_FLAG_SINGLE_INSTANCE` (corresponding to `gpd.ta.singleInstance` and `TA_FLAG_INSTANCE_KEEP_ALIVE` (corresponding to `gpd.ta.keepAlive`). The behavior of these TAs may depend on memory that is preserved between sessions, and the ability of an attacker to panic the TA and reload it with a clean memory space can compromise the behavior of those TAs. A critical example of this is the optee_ftpm TA. It uses the kept alive memory to hold PCR values, which crucially must be non-resettable. An attacker who can trigger a panic in the fTPM TA can reset the PCRs, and then extend them PCRs with whatever they choose, falsifying boot measurements, accessing sealed data, and potentially more. The impact of this issue depends significantly on the behavior of affected TAs. For some, it could manifest as a denial of service, while for others, like the fTPM TA, it can result in the disclosure of sensitive data. Anyone running the fTPM TA is affected, but similar attacks may be possible on other TAs that leverage the Secure Storage API. A fix is available in commit 941a58d78c99c4754fbd4ec3079ec9e1d596af8f.",2025-07-04T14:15Z,N/A
CVE-2025-38234,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

sched/rt: Fix race in push_rt_task

Overview
========
When a CPU chooses to call push_rt_task and picks a task to push to
another CPU's runqueue then it will call find_lock_lowest_rq method
which would take a double lock on both CPUs' runqueues. If one of the
locks aren't readily available, it may lead to dropping the current
runqueue lock and reacquiring both the locks at once. During this window
it is possible that the task is already migrated and is running on some
other CPU. These cases are already handled. However, if the task is
migrated and has already been executed and another CPU is now trying to
wake it up (ttwu) such that it is queued again on the runqeue
(on_rq is 1) and also if the task was run by the same CPU, then the
current checks will pass even though the task was migrated out and is no
longer in the pushable tasks list.

Crashes
=======
This bug resulted in quite a few flavors of crashes triggering kernel
panics with various crash signatures such as assert failures, page
faults, null pointer dereferences, and queue corruption errors all
coming from scheduler itself.

CVE-2025-38229,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

media: cxusb: no longer judge rbuf when the write fails

syzbot reported a uninit-value in cxusb_i2c_xfer. [1]

Only when the write operation of usb_bulk_msg() in dvb_usb_generic_rw()
succeeds and rlen is greater than 0, the read operation of usb_bulk_msg()
will be executed to read rlen bytes of data from the dvb device into the
rbuf.

In this case, although rlen is 1, the write operation failed which resulted
in the dvb read operation not being executed, and ultimately variable i was
not initialized.

can: kvaser_pciefd: refine error prone echo_skb_max handling logic

echo_skb_max should define the supported upper limit of echo_skb[]
allocated inside the netdevice's priv. The corresponding size value
provided by this driver to alloc_candev() is KVASER_PCIEFD_CAN_TX_MAX_COUNT
which is 17.

But later echo_skb_max is rounded up to the nearest power of two (for the
max case, that would be 32) and the tx/ack indices calculated further
during tx/rx may exceed the upper array boundary. Kasan reported this for
the ack case inside kvaser_pciefd_handle_ack_packet(), though the xmit
function has actually caught the same thing earlier.

Tx max count definitely matters for kvaser_pciefd_tx_avail(), but for seq
numbers' generation that's not the case - we're free to calculate them as
would be more convenient, not taking tx max count into account. The only
downside is that the size of echo_skb[] should correspond to the max seq
number (not tx max count), so in some situations a bit more memory would
be consumed than could be.

Thus make the size of the underlying echo_skb[] sufficient for the rounded
max tx value.

CVE-2025-38222,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ext4: inline: fix len overflow in ext4_prepare_inline_data

When running the following code on an ext4 filesystem with inline_data
feature enabled, it will lead to the bug below.

        fd = open(""file1"", O_RDWR | O_CREAT | O_TRUNC, 0666);
        ftruncate(fd, 30);
        pwrite(fd, ""a"", 1, (1UL << 40) + 5UL);

That happens because write_begin will succeed as when
ext4_generic_write_inline_data calls ext4_prepare_inline_data, pos + len
will be truncated, leading to ext4_prepare_inline_data parameter to be 6
instead of 0x10000000006.

Then, later when write_end is called, we hit:

        BUG_ON(pos + len > EXT4_I(inode)->i_inline_size);

at ext4_write_inline_data.

Fix it by using a loff_t type for the len parameter in
ext4_prepare_inline_data instead of an unsigned int.

This occurs when processing a symlink inode from the orphan list. The
partial block zeroing code in the truncate path calls
ext4_dirty_journalled_data() -> folio_mark_dirty(). The latter calls
mapping->a_ops->dirty_folio(), but symlink inodes are not assigned an
a_ops vector in ext4, hence the crash.

To avoid this problem, update the ext4_dirty_journalled_data() helper to
only mark the folio dirty on regular files (for which a_ops is
assigned). This also matches the journaling logic in the ext4_symlink()
creation path, where ext4_handle_dirty_metadata() is called directly.",2025-07-04T14:15Z,N/A

CVE-2025-38217,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

hwmon: (ftsteutates) Fix TOCTOU race in fts_read()

In the fts_read() function, when handling hwmon_pwm_auto_channels_temp,
the code accesses the shared variable data->fan_source[channel] twice
without holding any locks. It is first checked against
FTS_FAN_SOURCE_INVALID, and if the check passes, it is read again
when used as an argument to the BIT() macro.

This creates a Time-of-Check to Time-of-Use (TOCTOU) race condition.
Another thread executing fts_update_device() can modify the value of
data->fan_source[channel] between the check and its use. If the value
is changed to FTS_FAN_SOURCE_INVALID (0xff) during this window, the
BIT() macro will be called with a large shift value (BIT(255)).
A bit shift by a value greater than or equal to the type width is
undefined behavior and can lead to a crash or incorrect values being
returned to userspace.

Fix this by reading data->fan_source[channel] into a local variable
once, eliminating the race condition. Additionally, add a bounds check
to ensure the value is less than BITS_PER_LONG before passing it to
the BIT() macro, making the code more robust against undefined behavior.

iommu/vt-d: Restore context entry setup order for aliased devices

Commit 2031c469f816 (""iommu/vt-d: Add support for static identity domain"")

var_to_display() fails, it can not prevent the panic because fbcon_init()
does not return error code. Considering this and the comment in the code

better to prevent registering the fb_info if its mode was not set

RDMA/iwcm: Fix use-after-free of work objects after cm_id destruction

The commit 59c68ac31e15 (""iw_cm: free cm_id resources on the last
deref"") simplified cm_id resource management by freeing cm_id once all
references to the cm_id were removed. The references are removed either
upon completion of iw_cm event handlers or when the application destroys
the cm_id. This commit introduced the use-after-free condition where
cm_id_private object could still be in use by event handler works during
the destruction of cm_id. The commit aee2424246f9 (""RDMA/iwcm: Fix a
use-after-free related to destroying CM IDs"") addressed this use-after-
free by flushing all pending works at the cm_id destruction.

However, still another use-after-free possibility remained. It happens
with the work objects allocated for each cm_id_priv within
alloc_work_entries() during cm_id creation, and subsequently freed in
dealloc_work_entries() once all references to the cm_id are removed.
If the cm_id's last reference is decremented in the event handler work,
the work object for the work itself gets removed, and causes the use-

configfs-tsm-report: Fix NULL dereference of tsm_ops

Unlike sysfs, the lifetime of configfs objects is controlled by
userspace. There is no mechanism for the kernel to find and delete all
created config-items. Instead, the configfs-tsm-report mechanism has an
expectation that tsm_unregister() can happen at any time and cause
established config-item access to start failing.

That expectation is not fully satisfied. While tsm_report_read(),
tsm_report_{is,is_bin}_visible(), and tsm_report_make_item() safely fail
if tsm_ops have been unregistered, tsm_report_privlevel_store()
tsm_report_provider_show() fail to check for ops registration. Add the
missing checks for tsm_ops having been removed.

Now, in supporting the ability for tsm_unregister() to always succeed,
it leaves the problem of what to do with lingering config-items. The
expectation is that the admin that arranges for the ->remove() (unbind)
of the ${tsm_arch}-guest driver is also responsible for deletion of all
open config-items. Until that deletion happens, ->probe() (reload /
bind) of the ${tsm_arch}-guest driver fails.

This allows for emergency shutdown / revocation of attestation

nvme-tcp: remove tag set when second admin queue config fails

Commit 104d0e2f6222 (""nvme-fabrics: reset admin connection for secure
concatenation"") modified nvme_tcp_setup_ctrl() to call
nvme_tcp_configure_admin_queue() twice. The first call prepares for
DH-CHAP negotitation, and the second call is required for secure
concatenation. However, this change triggered BUG KASAN slab-use-after-

repeating the blktests test case nvme/063 a few times [1].

When the BUG happens, nvme_tcp_create_ctrl() fails in the call chain
below:

nvme_tcp_create_ctrl()
 nvme_tcp_alloc_ctrl() new=true             ... Alloc nvme_tcp_ctrl and admin_tag_set
 nvme_tcp_setup_ctrl() new=true
  nvme_tcp_configure_admin_queue() new=true ... Succeed
   nvme_alloc_admin_tag_set()               ... Alloc the tag set for admin_tag_set

 nvme_uninit_ctrl()
 nvme_put_ctrl()                            ... Free up the nvme_tcp_ctrl and admin_tag_set

The first call of nvme_tcp_configure_admin_queue() succeeds with
new=true argument. The second call fails with new=false argument. This
second call does not call nvme_remove_admin_tag_set() on failure, due to
the new=false argument. Then the admin tag set is not removed. However,
nvme_tcp_create_ctrl() assumes that nvme_tcp_setup_ctrl() would call
nvme_remove_admin_tag_set(). Then it frees up struct nvme_tcp_ctrl which
has admin_tag_set field. Later on, the timeout handler accesses the
admin_tag_set field and causes the BUG KASAN slab-use-after-free.

To not leave the admin tag set, call nvme_remove_admin_tag_set() when
the second nvme_tcp_configure_admin_queue() call fails. Do not return
from nvme_tcp_setup_ctrl() on failure. Instead, jump to ""destroy_admin""

mm: fix uprobe pte be overwritten when expanding vma

Patch series ""Fix uprobe pte be overwritten when expanding vma"".


This patch (of 4):

We encountered a BUG alert triggered by Syzkaller as follows:
   BUG: Bad rss-counter state mm:00000000b4a60fca type:MM_ANONPAGES val:1

And we can reproduce it with the following steps:
1. register uprobe on file at zero offset
2. mmap the file at zero offset:
   addr1 = mmap(NULL, 2 * 4096, PROT_NONE, MAP_PRIVATE, fd, 0);
3. mremap part of vma1 to new vma2:
   addr2 = mremap(addr1, 4096, 2 * 4096, MREMAP_MAYMOVE);
4. mremap back to orig addr1:
   mremap(addr2, 4096, 4096, MREMAP_MAYMOVE | MREMAP_FIXED, addr1);

In step 3, the vma1 range [addr1, addr1 + 4096] will be remap to new vma2
with range [addr2, addr2 + 8192], and remap uprobe anon page from the vma1
to vma2, then unmap the vma1 range [addr1, addr1 + 4096].

In step 4, the vma2 range [addr2, addr2 + 4096] will be remap back to the
addr range [addr1, addr1 + 4096].  Since the addr range [addr1 + 4096,
addr1 + 8192] still maps the file, it will take vma_merge_new_range to
expand the range, and then do uprobe_mmap in vma_complete.  Since the
merged vma pgoff is also zero offset, it will install uprobe anon page to
the merged vma.  However, the upcomming move_page_tables step, which use
set_pte_at to remap the vma2 uprobe pte to the merged vma, will overwrite
the newly uprobe pte in the merged vma, and lead that pte to be orphan.

Since the uprobe pte will be remapped to the merged vma, we can remove the
unnecessary uprobe_mmap upon merged vma.

This problem was first found in linux-6.6.y and also exists in the
community syzkaller:

Kernel panic - not syncing: Fatal exception

[ Analysis ]

We believe that we have found a concurrency bug in the `fs/jfs` module
that results in a null pointer dereference. There is a closely related
issue which has been fixed:

https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=d6c1b3599b2feb5c7291f5ac3a36e5fa7cedb234

... but, unfortunately, the accepted patch appears to still be
susceptible to a null pointer dereference under some interleavings.

To trigger the bug, we think that `JFS_SBI(ipbmap->i_sb)->bmap` is set
to NULL in `dbFreeBits` and then dereferenced in `jfs_ioc_trim`. This
bug manifests quite rarely under normal circumstances, but is
triggereable from a syz-program.",2025-07-04T14:15Z,N/A

drm/msm/a7xx: Call CP_RESET_CONTEXT_STATE

Calling this packet is necessary when we switch contexts because there
are various pieces of state used by userspace to synchronize between BR

they are in a ""safe"" state when switching contexts. Otherwise a
userspace submission in one context could cause another context to
function incorrectly and hang, effectively a denial of service (although
without leaking data). This was missed during initial a7xx bringup.

atmtcp_c_send() accesses skb->data as struct atmtcp_hdr after
checking if skb->len is 0, but it's not enough.

Also, when skb->len == 0, skb and sk (vcc) were leaked because

CVE-2025-38183,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: lan743x: fix potential out-of-bounds write in lan743x_ptp_io_event_clock_get()

Before calling lan743x_ptp_io_event_clock_get(), the 'channel' value
is checked against the maximum value of PCI11X1X_PTP_IO_MAX_CHANNELS(8).
This seems correct and aligns with the PTP interrupt status register
(PTP_INT_STS) specifications.

However, lan743x_ptp_io_event_clock_get() writes to ptp->extts[] with
only LAN743X_PTP_N_EXTTS(4) elements, using channel as an index:

    lan743x_ptp_io_event_clock_get(..., u8 channel,...)
    {
        ...
        /* Update Local timestamp */
        extts = &ptp->extts[channel];
        extts->ts.tv_sec = sec;
        ...
    }

To avoid an out-of-bounds write and utilize all the supported GPIO
inputs, set LAN743X_PTP_N_EXTTS to 8.

CVE-2025-38181,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

calipso: Fix null-ptr-deref in calipso_req_{set,del}attr().

syzkaller reported a null-ptr-deref in sock_omalloc() while allocating
a CALIPSO option.  [0]

The NULL is of struct sock, which was fetched by sk_to_full_sk() in
calipso_req_setattr().

Since commit a1a5344ddbe8 (""tcp: avoid two atomic ops for syncookies""),
reqsk->rsk_listener could be NULL when SYN Cookie is returned to its
client, as hinted by the leading SYN Cookie log.

Here are 3 options to fix the bug:

  1) Return 0 in calipso_req_setattr()
  2) Return an error in calipso_req_setattr()
  3) Alaways set rsk_listener

1) is no go as it bypasses LSM, but 2) effectively disables SYN Cookie
for CALIPSO.  3) is also no go as there have been many efforts to reduce
atomic ops and make TCP robust against DDoS.  See also commit 3b24d854cb35
(""tcp/dccp: do not touch listener sk_refcnt under synflood"").

As of the blamed commit, SYN Cookie already did not need refcounting,
and no one has stumbled on the bug for 9 years, so no CALIPSO user will
care about SYN Cookie.

Let's return an error in calipso_req_setattr() and calipso_req_delattr()
in the SYN Cookie case.

This can be reproduced by [1] on Fedora and now connect() of nc times out.

However, if the primary is a block device while the extra device

arm64/fpsimd: Discard stale CPU state when handling SME traps

The logic for handling SME traps manipulates saved FPSIMD/SVE/SME state
incorrectly, and a race with preemption can result in a task having
TIF_SME set and TIF_FOREIGN_FPSTATE clear even though the live CPU state
is stale (e.g. with SME traps enabled). This can result in warnings from
do_sme_acc() where SME traps are not expected while TIF_SME is set:

|        /* With TIF_SME userspace shouldn't generate any traps */
|        if (test_and_set_thread_flag(TIF_SME))
|                WARN_ON(1);

This is very similar to the SVE issue we fixed in commit:

  751ecf6afd6568ad (""arm64/sve: Discard stale CPU state when handling SVE traps"")

The race can occur when the SME trap handler is preempted before and
after manipulating the saved FPSIMD/SVE/SME state, starting and ending on
the same CPU, e.g.

| void do_sme_acc(unsigned long esr, struct pt_regs *regs)
| {
|         // Trap on CPU 0 with TIF_SME clear, SME traps enabled
|         // task->fpsimd_cpu is 0.
|         // per_cpu_ptr(&fpsimd_last_state, 0) is task.
|
|         ...
|
|         // Preempted; migrated from CPU 0 to CPU 1.
|         // TIF_FOREIGN_FPSTATE is set.
|
|         get_cpu_fpsimd_context();
|
|         /* With TIF_SME userspace shouldn't generate any traps */
|         if (test_and_set_thread_flag(TIF_SME))
|                 WARN_ON(1);
|
|         if (!test_thread_flag(TIF_FOREIGN_FPSTATE)) {
|                 unsigned long vq_minus_one =
|                         sve_vq_from_vl(task_get_sme_vl(current)) - 1;
|                 sme_set_vq(vq_minus_one);
|
|                 fpsimd_bind_task_to_cpu();
|         }
|
|         put_cpu_fpsimd_context();
|
|         // Preempted; migrated from CPU 1 to CPU 0.
|         // task->fpsimd_cpu is still 0
|         // If per_cpu_ptr(&fpsimd_last_state, 0) is still task then:
|         // - Stale HW state is reused (with SME traps enabled)
|         // - TIF_FOREIGN_FPSTATE is cleared
|         // - A return to userspace skips HW state restore
| }

Fix the case where the state is not live and TIF_FOREIGN_FPSTATE is set
by calling fpsimd_flush_task_state() to detach from the saved CPU
state. This ensures that a subsequent context switch will not reuse the
stale CPU state, and will instead set TIF_FOREIGN_FPSTATE, forcing the
new state to be reloaded from memory prior to a return to userspace.

CVE-2025-38169,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

arm64/fpsimd: Avoid clobbering kernel FPSIMD state with SMSTOP

On system with SME, a thread's kernel FPSIMD state may be erroneously
clobbered during a context switch immediately after that state is
restored. Systems without SME are unaffected.

If the CPU happens to be in streaming SVE mode before a context switch
to a thread with kernel FPSIMD state, fpsimd_thread_switch() will
restore the kernel FPSIMD state using fpsimd_load_kernel_state() while
the CPU is still in streaming SVE mode. When fpsimd_thread_switch()
subsequently calls fpsimd_flush_cpu_state(), this will execute an
SMSTOP, causing an exit from streaming SVE mode. The exit from
streaming SVE mode will cause the hardware to reset a number of
FPSIMD/SVE/SME registers, clobbering the FPSIMD state.

FPSIMD state.",2025-07-03T09:15Z,N/A

After calling bpf_exec_tx_verdict(), the size of msg_pl->sg may increase,
e.g., when the BPF program executes bpf_msg_push_data().

If the BPF program sets cork_bytes and sg.size is smaller than cork_bytes,
it will return -ENOSPC and attempt to roll back to the non-zero copy
logic. However, during rollback, msg->msg_iter is reset, but since
msg_pl->sg.size has been increased, subsequent executions will exceed the
actual size of msg_iter.
'''
iov_iter_revert(&msg->msg_iter, msg_pl->sg.size - orig_size);
'''

The changes in this commit are based on the following considerations:

1. When cork_bytes is set, rolling back to non-zero copy logic is
pointless and can directly go to zero-copy logic.

2. We can not calculate the correct number of bytes to revert msg_iter.

Assume the original data is ""abcdefgh"" (8 bytes), and after 3 pushes
by the BPF program, it becomes 11-byte data: ""abc?de?fgh?"".
Then, we set cork_bytes to 6, which means the first 6 bytes have been
processed, and the remaining 5 bytes ""?fgh?"" will be cached until the
length meets the cork_bytes requirement.

However, some data in ""?fgh?"" is not within 'sg->msg_iter'
(but in msg_pl instead), especially the data ""?"" we pushed.

So it doesn't seem as simple as just reverting through an offset of
msg_iter.

3. For non-TLS sockets in tcp_bpf_sendmsg, when a ""cork"" situation occurs,
the user-space send() doesn't return an error, and the returned length is
the same as the input length parameter, even if some data is cached.

Additionally, I saw that the current non-zero-copy logic for handling
corking is written as:
'''
line 1177
else if (ret != -EAGAIN) {
	if (ret == -ENOSPC)
		ret = 0;
	goto send_end;
'''

So it's ok to just return 'copied' without error when a ""cork"" situation
occurs.",2025-07-03T09:15Z,N/A

The panic originates from the assertion BUG_ON(skb_shared(skb)) in
skb_linearize(). A previous commit(see Fixes tag) introduced skb_get()
to avoid race conditions between skb operations in the backlog and skb
release in the recvmsg path. However, this caused the panic to always
occur when skb_linearize is executed.

The ""--rx-strp 100000"" parameter forces the RX path to use the strparser
module which aggregates data until it reaches 100KB before calling sockmap
logic. The 100KB payload exceeds MAX_MSG_FRAGS, triggering skb_linearize.

To fix this issue, just move skb_get into sk_psock_skb_ingress_enqueue.

Based on the fact that we already wait for the workqueue to finish in
sock_map_close() if psock is held, we simply increase the psock
reference count to avoid race conditions.

With this patch, if the backlog thread is running, sock_map_close() will
wait for the backlog thread to complete and cancel all pending work.

If no backlog running, any pending work that hasn't started by then will
fail when invoked by sk_psock_get(), as the psock reference count have
been zeroed, and sk_psock_drop() will cancel all jobs via
cancel_delayed_work_sync().

In summary, we require synchronization to coordinate the backlog thread
and close() thread.

net: usb: aqc111: fix error handling of usbnet read calls

Syzkaller, courtesy of syzbot, identified an error (see report [1]) in
aqc111 driver, caused by incomplete sanitation of usb read calls'
results. This problem is quite similar to the one fixed in commit
920a9fa27e78 (""net: asix: add proper error handling of usb read errors"").

For instance, usbnet_read_cmd() may read fewer than 'size' bytes,
even if the caller expected the full amount, and aqc111_read_cmd()
will not check its result properly. As [1] shows, this may lead
to MAC address in aqc111_bind() being only partly initialized,
triggering KMSAN warnings.

Fix the issue by verifying that the number of bytes read is

RDMA/cma: Fix hang when cma_netevent_callback fails to queue_work

The cited commit fixed a crash when cma_netevent_callback was called for
a cma_id while work on that id from a previous call had not yet started.
The work item was re-initialized in the second call, which corrupted the
work item currently in the work queue.

However, it left a problem when queue_work fails (because the item is
still pending in the work queue from a previous call). In this case,
cma_id_put (which is called in the work handler) is therefore not
called. This results in a userspace process hang (zombie process).

Fix this by calling cma_id_put() if queue_work fails.",2025-07-03T09:15Z,N/A

net: phy: clear phydev->devlink when the link is deleted

There is a potential crash issue when disabling and re-enabling the
network port. When disabling the network port, phy_detach() calls
device_link_del() to remove the device link, but it does not clear
phydev->devlink, so phydev->devlink is not a NULL pointer. Then the
network port is re-enabled, but if phy_attach_direct() fails before
calling device_link_add(), the code jumps to the ""error"" label and
calls phy_detach(). Since phydev->devlink retains the old value from
the previous attach/detach cycle, device_link_del() uses the old value,
which accesses a NULL pointer and causes a crash. The simplified crash
log is as follows.

calipso: Don't call calipso functions for AF_INET sk.

syzkaller reported a null-ptr-deref in txopt_get(). [0]

The offset 0x70 was of struct ipv6_txoptions in struct ipv6_pinfo,
so struct ipv6_pinfo was NULL there.

However, this never happens for IPv6 sockets as inet_sk(sk)->pinet6
is always set in inet6_create(), meaning the socket was not IPv6 one.

The root cause is missing validation in netlbl_conn_setattr().

netlbl_conn_setattr() switches branches based on struct
sockaddr.sa_family, which is passed from userspace.  However,
netlbl_conn_setattr() does not check if the address family matches
the socket.

The syzkaller must have called connect() for an IPv6 address on
an IPv4 socket.

We have a proper validation in tcp_v[46]_connect(), but
security_socket_connect() is called in the earlier stage.

Let's copy the validation to netlbl_conn_setattr().

dm: fix dm_blk_report_zones

If dm_get_live_table() returned NULL, dm_put_live_table() was never
called. Also, it is possible that md->zone_revalidate_map will change
while calling this function. Only read it once, so that we are always
using the same value. Otherwise we might miss a call to
dm_put_live_table().

Finally, while md->zone_revalidate_map is set and a process is calling
blk_revalidate_disk_zones() to set up the zone append emulation
resources, it is possible that another process, perhaps triggered by
blkdev_report_zones_ioctl(), will call dm_blk_report_zones(). If
blk_revalidate_disk_zones() fails, these resources can be freed while
the other process is still using them, causing a use-after-free error.

blk_revalidate_disk_zones() will only ever be called when initially
setting up the zone append emulation resources, such as when setting up
a zoned dm-crypt table for the first time. Further table swaps will not
set md->zone_revalidate_map or call blk_revalidate_disk_zones().
However it must be called using the new table (referenced by
md->zone_revalidate_map) and the new queue limits while the DM device is
suspended. dm_blk_report_zones() needs some way to distinguish between a
call from blk_revalidate_disk_zones(), which must be allowed to use
md->zone_revalidate_map to access this not yet activated table, and all
other calls to dm_blk_report_zones(), which should not be allowed while
the device is suspended and cannot use md->zone_revalidate_map, since
the zone resources might be freed by the process currently calling
blk_revalidate_disk_zones().

Solve this by tracking the process that sets md->zone_revalidate_map in
dm_revalidate_zones() and only allowing that process to make use of it
in dm_blk_report_zones().",2025-07-03T09:15Z,N/A
CVE-2025-38140,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

dm: limit swapping tables for devices with zone write plugs

dm_revalidate_zones() only allowed new or previously unzoned devices to
call blk_revalidate_disk_zones(). If the device was already zoned,
disk->nr_zones would always equal md->nr_zones, so dm_revalidate_zones()
returned without doing any work. This would make the zoned settings for
the device not match the new table. If the device had zone write plug
resources, it could run into errors like bdev_zone_is_seq() reading
invalid memory because disk->conv_zones_bitmap was the wrong size.

If the device doesn't have any zone write plug resources, calling
blk_revalidate_disk_zones() will always correctly update device.  If
blk_revalidate_disk_zones() fails, it can still overwrite or clear the
current disk->nr_zones value. In this case, DM must restore the previous
value of disk->nr_zones, so that the zoned settings will continue to
match the previous value that it fell back to.

If the device already has zone write plug resources,
blk_revalidate_disk_zones() will not correctly update them, if it is
called for arbitrary zoned device changes.  Since there is not much need
for this ability, the easiest solution is to disallow any table reloads
that change the zoned settings, for devices that already have zone plug
resources.  Specifically, if a device already has zone plug resources
allocated, it can only switch to another zoned table that also emulates
zone append.  Also, it cannot change the device size or the zone size. A
device can switch to an error target.",2025-07-03T09:15Z,N/A

It's possible to trigger use-after-free here by:

  (a) forcing rescan_work_func() to take a long time and
  (b) utilizing a pwrctrl driver that may be unloaded for some reason

Cancel outstanding work to ensure it is finished before we allow our data

CVE-2025-38136,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

usb: renesas_usbhs: Reorder clock handling and power management in probe

Reorder the initialization sequence in `usbhs_probe()` to enable runtime
PM before accessing registers, preventing potential crashes due to
uninitialized clocks.

Currently, in the probe path, registers are accessed before enabling the
clocks, leading to a synchronous external abort on the RZ/V2H SoC.
The problematic call flow is as follows:

    usbhs_probe()
        usbhs_sys_clock_ctrl()
            usbhs_bset()
                usbhs_write()
                    iowrite16()  <-- Register access before enabling clocks

Since `iowrite16()` is performed without ensuring the required clocks are
enabled, this can lead to access errors. To fix this, enable PM runtime
early in the probe function and ensure clocks are acquired before register
access, preventing crashes like the following on RZ/V2H:

net: fix udp gso skb_segment after pull from frag_list

Commit a1e40ac5b5e9 (""net: gso: fix udp gso fraglist segmentation after
pull from frag_list"") detected invalid geometry in frag_list skbs and
redirects them from skb_segment_list to more robust skb_segment. But some
packets with modified geometry can also hit bugs in that code. We don't
know how many such cases exist. Addressing each one by one also requires
touching the complex skb_segment code, which risks introducing bugs for
other types of skbs. Instead, linearize all these packets that fail the
basic invariants on gso fraglist skbs. That is more robust.

If only part of the fraglist payload is pulled into head_skb, it will
always cause exception when splitting skbs by skb_segment. For detailed
call stack information, see below.

Valid SKB_GSO_FRAGLIST skbs
- consist of two or more segments
- the head_skb holds the protocol headers plus first gso_size
- one or more frag_list skbs hold exactly one segment
- all but the last must be gso_size

Optional datapath hooks such as NAT and BPF (bpf_skb_pull_data) can
modify fraglist skbs, breaking these invariants.

In extreme cases they pull one part of data into skb linear. For UDP,
this  causes three payloads with lengths of (11,11,10) bytes were

e1000: Move cancel_work_sync to avoid deadlock

Previously, e1000_down called cancel_work_sync for the e1000 reset task
(via e1000_down_and_stop), which takes RTNL.

As reported by users and syzbot, a deadlock is possible in the following
scenario:

CPU 0:
  - RTNL is held
  - e1000_close
  - e1000_down
  - cancel_work_sync (cancel / wait for e1000_reset_task())

CPU 1:
  - process_one_work
  - e1000_reset_task
  - take RTNL

To remedy this, avoid calling cancel_work_sync from e1000_down

call cancel_work_sync for e1000_reset_task when the device is being

net: Fix TOCTOU issue in sk_is_readable()

sk->sk_prot->sock_is_readable is a valid function pointer when sk resides
in a sockmap. After the last sk_psock_put() (which usually happens when
socket is removed from sockmap), sk->sk_prot gets restored and
sk->sk_prot->sock_is_readable becomes NULL.

This makes sk_is_readable() racy, if the value of sk->sk_prot is reloaded
after the initial check. Which in turn may lead to a null pointer
dereference.

Ensure the function pointer does not turn NULL after the check.",2025-07-03T09:15Z,N/A

net/mdiobus: Fix potential out-of-bounds read/write access

When using publicly available tools like 'mdio-tools' to read/write data
from/to network interface and its PHY via mdiobus, there is no verification of
parameters passed to the ioctl and it accepts any mdio address.
Currently there is support for 32 addresses in kernel via PHY_MAX_ADDR define,

CVE-2025-38100,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

x86/iopl: Cure TIF_IO_BITMAP inconsistencies

io_bitmap_exit() is invoked from exit_thread() when a task exists or
when a fork fails. In the latter case the exit_thread() cleans up
resources which were allocated during fork().

io_bitmap_exit() invokes task_update_io_bitmap(), which in turn ends up
in tss_update_io_bitmap(). tss_update_io_bitmap() operates on the
current task. If current has TIF_IO_BITMAP set, but no bitmap installed,
tss_update_io_bitmap() crashes with a NULL pointer dereference.

There are two issues, which lead to that problem:

  1) io_bitmap_exit() should not invoke task_update_io_bitmap() when
     the task, which is cleaned up, is not the current task. That's a
     clear indicator for a cleanup after a failed fork().

  2) A task should not have TIF_IO_BITMAP set and neither a bitmap
     installed nor IOPL emulation level 3 activated.

     This happens when a kernel thread is created in the context of
     a user space thread, which has TIF_IO_BITMAP set as the thread
     flags are copied and the IO bitmap pointer is cleared.

     Other than in the failed fork() case this has no impact because
     kernel threads including IO workers never return to user space and
     therefore never invoke tss_update_io_bitmap().

Cure this by adding the missing cleanups and checks:

  1) Prevent io_bitmap_exit() to invoke task_update_io_bitmap() if
     the to be cleaned up task is not the current task.

  2) Clear TIF_IO_BITMAP in copy_thread() unconditionally. For user
     space forks it is set later, when the IO bitmap is inherited in
     io_bitmap_share().

For paranoia sake, add a warning into tss_update_io_bitmap() to catch
the case, when that code is invoked with inconsistent state.",2025-07-03T09:15Z,N/A

espintcp: remove encap socket caching to avoid reference leak

The current scheme for caching the encap socket can lead to reference
leaks when we try to delete the netns.

The reference chain is: xfrm_state -> enacp_sk -> netns

Since the encap socket is a userspace socket, it holds a reference on
the netns. If we delete the espintcp state (through flush or
individual delete) before removing the netns, the reference on the
socket is dropped and the netns is correctly deleted. Otherwise, the
netns may not be reachable anymore (if all processes within the ns
have terminated), so we cannot delete the xfrm state to drop its
reference on the socket.

This patch results in a small (~2% in my tests) performance
regression.

A GC-type mechanism could be added for the socket cache, to clear
references if the state hasn't been used ""recently"", but it's a lot
more complex than just not caching the socket.",2025-07-03T09:15Z,N/A

CVE-2025-34092,"A cookie encryption bypass vulnerability exists in Google Chrome’s AppBound mechanism due to weak path validation logic within the elevation service. When Chrome encrypts a cookie key, it records its own executable path as validation metadata. Later, when decrypting, the elevation service compares the requesting process’s path to this stored path. However, due to path canonicalization inconsistencies, an attacker can impersonate Chrome (e.g., by naming their binary chrome.exe and placing it in a similar path) and successfully retrieve the encrypted cookie key. This allows malicious processes to retrieve cookies intended to be restricted to the Chrome process only.

Confirmed in Google Chrome with AppBound Encryption enabled. Other Chromium-based browsers may be affected if they implement similar COM-based encryption mechanisms.",2025-07-02T20:15Z,N/A
CVE-2025-34091,"A padding oracle vulnerability exists in Google Chrome’s AppBound cookie encryption mechanism due to observable decryption failure behavior in Windows Event Logs when handling malformed ciphertext in SYSTEM-DPAPI-encrypted blobs. A local attacker can repeatedly send malformed ciphertexts to the Chrome elevation service and distinguish between padding and MAC errors, enabling a padding oracle attack. This allows partial decryption of the SYSTEM-DPAPI layer and eventual recovery of the user-DPAPI encrypted cookie key, which is trivially decrypted by the attacker’s own context. This issue undermines the core purpose of AppBound Encryption by enabling low-privileged cookie theft through cryptographic misuse and verbose error feedback.

Confirmed in Google Chrome with AppBound Encryption enabled. Other Chromium-based browsers may be affected if they implement similar COM-based encryption mechanisms.

This behavior arises from a combination of Chrome’s AppBound implementation and the way Microsoft Windows DPAPI reports decryption failures via Event Logs. As such, the vulnerability relies on cryptographic behavior and error visibility in all supported versions of Windows.",2025-07-02T20:15Z,N/A
CVE-2025-34090,"A security bypass vulnerability exists in Google Chrome AppBound cookie encryption mechanism due to insufficient validation of COM server paths during inter-process communication. A local low-privileged attacker can hijack the COM class identifier (CLSID) registration used by Chrome's elevation service and point it to a non-existent or malicious binary. When this hijack occurs, Chrome silently falls back to the legacy cookie encryption mechanism (protected only by user-DPAPI), thereby enabling cookie decryption by any user-context malware without SYSTEM-level access. This flaw bypasses the protections intended by the AppBound encryption design and allows cookie theft from Chromium-based browsers.

Confirmed in Google Chrome with AppBound Encryption enabled. Other Chromium-based browsers may be affected if they implement similar COM-based encryption mechanisms.",2025-07-02T20:15Z,N/A

CVE-2025-38089,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

sunrpc: handle SVC_GARBAGE during svc auth processing as auth error

tianshuo han reported a remotely-triggerable crash if the client sends a
kernel RPC server a specially crafted packet. If decoding the RPC reply
fails in such a way that SVC_GARBAGE is returned without setting the
rq_accept_statp pointer, then that pointer can be dereferenced and a
value stored there.

If it's the first time the thread has processed an RPC, then that
pointer will be set to NULL and the kernel will crash. In other cases,
it could create a memory scribble.

The server sunrpc code treats a SVC_GARBAGE return from svc_authenticate
or pg_authenticate as if it should send a GARBAGE_ARGS reply. RFC 5531
says that if authentication fails that the RPC should be rejected
instead with a status of AUTH_ERR.

Handle a SVC_GARBAGE return as an AUTH_ERROR, with a reason of
AUTH_BADCRED instead of returning GARBAGE_ARGS in that case. This
sidesteps the whole problem of touching the rpc_accept_statp pointer in
this situation and avoids the crash.",2025-06-30T08:15Z,N/A

Prior to version 25.4.0, the conda-build recipe processing logic has been found to be vulnerable to arbitrary code execution due to unsafe evaluation of recipe selectors. Currently, conda-build uses the eval function to process embedded selectors in meta.yaml files. This approach evaluates user-defined expressions without proper sanitization, which allows arbitrary code to be executed during the build process. As a result, the integrity of the build environment is compromised, and unauthorized commands or file operations may be performed. The vulnerability stems from the inherent risk of using eval() on untrusted input in a context intended to control dynamic build configurations. By directly interpreting selector expressions, conda-build creates a potential execution pathway for malicious code, violating security assumptions.

Prior to version 1.8.39, the search component does not validate permissions correctly, which allows attackers to determine the existence of hidden (draft, unapproved, or soft-deleted) threads containing specified text in the title. The visibility state (`mybb_threads.visible` integer column) of threads is not validated in internal search queries, whose result is used to output a general success or failure of the search. While MyBB validates permissions when displaying the final search results, a search operation that internally produces at least one result outputs a redirect response (as a HTTP redirect, or a success message page with delayed redirect, depending on configuration). On the other hand, a search operation that internally produces no results outputs a corresponding message in the response without a redirect. This allows a user to determine whether threads matching title search parameters exist, including draft threads (`visible` with a value of `-2`), soft-deleted threads (`visible` with a value of `-1`), and unapproved threads (`visible` with a value of `0`); in addition to displaying generally visible threads (`visible` with a value of `1`). This vulnerability does not affect other layers of permissions. In order to exploit the vulnerability, the user must have access to the search functionality, and general access to forums containing the thread(s). The vulnerability does not expose the message content of posts. MyBB 1.8.39 resolves this issue.",2025-06-02T16:15Z,N/A

This happens because we have another success path for the zoned mode. When
there is no active zone available, btrfs_reserve_extent() returns
-EAGAIN. In this case, we have two reactions.

(1) If the given range is never allocated, we can only wait for someone
    to finish a zone, so wait on BTRFS_FS_NEED_ZONE_FINISH bit and retry
    afterward.

(2) Or, if some allocations are already done, we must bail out and let
    the caller to send IOs for the allocation. This is because these IOs
    may be necessary to finish a zone.

The commit 06f364284794 (""btrfs: do proper folio cleanup when
cow_file_range() failed"") moved the unlock code from the inside of the
loop to the outside. So, previously, the allocated extents are unlocked
just after the allocation and so before returning from the function.
However, they are no longer unlocked on the case (2) above. That caused
the hang issue.

Fix the issue by modifying the 'end' to the end of the allocated
range. Then, we can exit the loop and the same unlock code can properly
handle the case.",2025-04-01T16:15Z,N/A

[CAUSE]
That failure is mostly from cow_file_range(), where we can hit -ENOSPC.

Although the -ENOSPC is already a bug related to our space reservation
code, let's just focus on the error handling.

For example, we have the following dirty range [0, 64K) of an inode,
with 4K sector size and 4K page size:

   0        16K        32K       48K       64K
   |///////////////////////////////////////|
   |#######################################|

Where |///| means page are still dirty, and |###| means the extent io
tree has EXTENT_DELALLOC flag.

- Enter extent_writepage() for page 0

- Enter btrfs_run_delalloc_range() for range [0, 64K)

- Enter cow_file_range() for range [0, 64K)

- Function btrfs_reserve_extent() only reserved one 16K extent
  So we created extent map and ordered extent for range [0, 16K)

   0        16K        32K       48K       64K
   |////////|//////////////////////////////|
   |<- OE ->|##############################|

   And range [0, 16K) has its delalloc flag cleared.
   But since we haven't yet submit any bio, involved 4 pages are still
   dirty.

- Function btrfs_reserve_extent() returns with -ENOSPC
  Now we have to run error cleanup, which will clear all
  EXTENT_DELALLOC* flags and clear the dirty flags for the remaining
  ranges:

   0        16K        32K       48K       64K
   |////////|                              |
   |        |                              |

  Note that range [0, 16K) still has its pages dirty.

- Some time later, writeback is triggered again for the range [0, 16K)
  since the page range still has dirty flags.

- btrfs_run_delalloc_range() will do nothing because there is no
  EXTENT_DELALLOC flag.

- extent_writepage_io() finds page 0 has no ordered flag
  Which falls into the COW fixup path, triggering the BUG_ON().

Unfortunately this error handling bug dates back to the introduction of
btrfs.  Thankfully with the abuse of COW fixup, at least it won't crash
the kernel.

[FIX]
Instead of immediately unlocking the extent and folios, we keep the extent
and folios locked until either erroring out or the whole delalloc range
finished.

When the whole delalloc range finished without error, we just unlock the
whole range with PAGE_SET_ORDERED (and PAGE_UNLOCK for !keep_locked
cases)

This happens because we fail to write out the free space cache in one
instance, come back around and attempt to write it again.  However on
the second pass through we go to call btrfs_get_extent() on the inode to
get the extent mapping.  Because this is a new block group, and with the
free space inode we always search the commit root to avoid deadlocking
with the tree, we find nothing and return a EXTENT_MAP_HOLE for the
requested range.

This happens because the first time we try to write the space cache out
we hit an error, and on an error we drop the extent mapping.  This is
normal for normal files, but the free space cache inode is special.  We
always expect the extent map to be correct.  Thus the second time
through we end up with a bogus extent map.

Since we're deprecating this feature, the most straightforward way to
fix this is to simply skip dropping the extent map range for this failed
range.

I shortened the test by using error injection to stress the area to make
it easier to reproduce.  With this patch in place we no longer panic
with my error injection test.",2024-04-03T15:15Z,5.5
